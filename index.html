        <p>Hello, there!</p>
        <p>I am currently based at Perimeter Institute as a Vera Florence Cooper Rubin Postdoctoral Research Fellow.</p>

	<p>I have completed my PhD at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Professor Ulrich Sperhake.
            My PhD thesis titled "Uncovering gravitational wave signatures of modified theories of gravity and exotic matter" can be found
            <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/f7c6898a-540d-46ef-8fa9-5eaf4aa687ca">here</a>. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Mathematics at University College London.</p>

	 <p>My current work broadly concerns numerical relativity and tests of general relativity (GR) using gravitational waves. I am interested in modeling and understanding the dynamics
    of compact objects in modified theories of gravity and the effects of "exotic matter." Some questions I explore: What are the gravitational wave signatures in theories beyond general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics?
    Can we distinguish these effects or break any possible degeneracies? What are the stability properties of exotic compact objects? Although my work is driven by numerics, I am also interested in exploring observational implications
    of modified theories of gravity and exotic compact objects. I aim to create a synergy between numerical relativity simulations and data analysis (such as Bayesian inference) to determine whether a specific theory can be probed with current or future gravitational wave detectors.
  </p>

  <p>I am part of an amazing numerical relativity code collaboration <a href="https://www.grchombo.org/">GRChombo</a> (also known as the GRTLCollaboration).
    Our collaboration has grown significantly in recent years, and we have made significant progress toward making the code open source—see our <a href="https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration">repository</a> for the latest updates.
    I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org/">LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</a> collaboration, which made the first observation of the gravitational wave event GW150914 from a binary black hole merger.
