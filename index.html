					Hello, there!
				</p> 
				
                <p>
                    I am currently based at Perimeter Institute as a Vera Florence Cooper Rubin Post Doctoral Research Fellow. </p> 
				
				<p> I have completed my PhD at Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Professor Ulrich Sperhake.
					My PhD thesis titled 'Uncovering gravitational wave signatures of modified theories of gravity and exotic matter' can be found <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/f7c6898a-540d-46ef-8fa9-5eaf4aa687ca">here</a>. Prior to that I completed my bachelors and masters degrees in Mathematics at University College London. </p>

	<p> My current work broadly concerns numerical relativity and tests of general relativity using gravitational waves. Understading the dynamics 
		of compact objects in modified theories of gravity and the effects of "exotic matter" have been the primary foci of my work. 
		Although my work is driven by the numerics, I am interested in exploring the observational implications of modified theories of gravity and exotic compact objects. 
		I therefore strive to create a synergy between numerical relativity simulations and data analysis (like Bayesian inference) and understand whether a specific theory in
		question can be probed with current or future gravitational wave detectors.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am part of an amazing numerical relativity code collaboration <a href="https://www.grchombo.org/">GRChombo</a> (also known as the GRTLCollaboration). 
		In recent years, our collaboration gained a lot of new members and made lots of progress towards making the code open source, see our <a href="https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration">repository</a> for the latest updates. 
		I am also a member of <a href="https://www.ligo.org/">LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</a> collaboration, which made the first observation of the gravitational wave 
		event GW150914 from a binary black hole merger.
