                    I am a PhD student at Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge.
					Before embraking on my PhD journey, I have completed my bachelors and masters degrees
					in Mathematics at University College London. 
				<p>

				</p>
					I specialise in Numerical Relativity and Tests of General Relativity using gravitational waves. I am part of an amazing numerical relativity code collaboration <a href="https://www.grchombo.org/">GRChombo</a> (also known as the GRTLCollaboration). GRChombo is a finite difference
					code and is built on the Chombo adaptive mesh refinement libraries. In recent years, our collaboration gained a lot of new members and
					made lots of progress towards making the code open source, see our <a href="https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration">repository</a> for the latest updates. I am also a member
					of <a href="https://www.ligo.org/">LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</a> collaboration, which made the first observation of the gravitational wave 
					event GW150914 from a binary black hole merger.

		My work concerns simualtions of binary systems mainly consisting of black holes and boson stars. Understading the dynamics 
		of compact objects in modified theories of gravity and the effects of "exotic matter" have been the primary foci of my studies. 
		Although my work is driven by the numerics, I am interested in exploring the observational implications of modified theories of gravity or exotic compact objects. I therefore strive
		to create a synergy between numerical relativity simulations and data analysis (like Bayesian inference) and understand whether a specific theory in
		question can be probed with current or future gravitational wave detectors.
