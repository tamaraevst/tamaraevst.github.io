        <p>Hello, there!</p>
        <p>I am currently based at Perimeter Institute as a Vera Florence Cooper Rubin Postdoctoral Research Fellow.</p>

	<p>I have completed my PhD at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Professor Ulrich Sperhake.
            My PhD thesis titled "Uncovering gravitational wave signatures of modified theories of gravity and exotic matter" can be found
            <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/f7c6898a-540d-46ef-8fa9-5eaf4aa687ca">here</a>. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Mathematics at University College London.</p>

	 <p>My current work broadly concerns numerical relativity and tests of general relativity (GR) using gravitational waves. I am interested in modelling and understanding the dynamics
    of compact objects in modified theories of gravity and the effects of "exotic matter". Some questions I explore: (i) What are the gravitational wave signatures in theories beyond general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics? (ii) Can we distinguish these effects or break any possible degeneracies? (iii) What are the (linear and non-linear) stability properties of exotic compact objects? (iv) How can we integrate machine learning techniques into current gravitational wave analysis and modelling? Although my work is driven by numerical and computational techniques, I like my research to follow a "vertically integrated" approach. In other words, I like to start from a theoretical idea or solution, study its predictions and observables in detail (analytically or numerically), and then carry these insights through to realistic gravitational-wave observations and data analysis.
  </p>

  <p>I am part of an amazing numerical relativity code collaboration <a href="https://www.grchombo.org/">GRChombo</a> (also known as the GRTLCollaboration).
    Our collaboration has grown significantly in recent years, and we have made significant progress toward making the code open source—see our <a href="https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration">repository</a> for the latest updates. The code is currenty being ported to GPUs, which would allow for much faster and efficient evolutions of coalescences of compact objects.
    I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org/">LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</a> collaboration, which made the first observation of the gravitational wave event GW150914 from a binary black hole merger.
