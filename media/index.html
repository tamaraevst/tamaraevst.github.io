<h2> High precision simulations of inspiralling boson star binaries </h2>

<p>
We were interviewed for a couple of artciles based off our <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.131401">publication</a> in Physical Review Letters. 
In this work we simulate with high-precision the inspiral, merger and ringdown of binaries consisting of two non-spinning boson stars. 
The accuracy and longevity of gravitational wave signals generated in the process is sufficient to perform gravitational wave analysis and assess the impact of a hypothetical boson star signal on gravitational wave observations. 
Our results show that binary boson star binaries may be detected with present gravitational wave detectors, however whether they can be completely distinguished from binaries of black hole and neutron stars, is a more complicated question. 
In a nutshell, we demonstrate how sifficiently compact boson star binaries can be very easily mistaken for binary black holes, whilst more 'dilute' boson star binaries can stand out as sore thumbs in the data, exhibiting smoking-gun features. 
If this sounds interesting, I encourage out to checkout our interviews and artciles about our work below:

<h2> "A day in the life of a physicist" illustration series </h2>

I have illustrated a series of comics on "A day in the life of a physicist" and a magical story of mice doing science. See "<a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/news/day-life-physicist">here</a>" to see the illustrations.
